# streamlit-langgraph

A powerful Python package that seamlessly integrates Streamlit’s intuitive web interface with LangGraph’s advanced multi-agent orchestration capabilities. Build interactive AI applications that feature multiple specialized agents collaborating in customizable workflows.

If you’re using Streamlit with a single agent, consider using [this package](https://github.com/sbslee/streamlit-openai/tree/main) instead. This project was also greatly inspired by that work, particularly for its general ideas and integration with the OpenAI API.

# In Development

In the baseline implementation, it utilizes the Response API for OpenAI usage, and for other LLMs, it uses create_agent from LangChain.

Note: This package uses langchain/langgraph version 1.0.1.
